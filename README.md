# Super Smash Bros Ultimate Matchup Optimizer
Introducing: The Smash Bros Ultimate Matchup Optimizier! It is an android app that, when told what character your opponent will be playing, tells you the best and worst matchups to counter it! Never pick the wrong character again! It is a little unpolished, but being that this was only my second hackathon, and that I worked all alone on it, I am extremely proud of what I could do in 24 hours.  Due to the time constraint, I was unable to type all of the matchup lists into the respective character pages. I did get a decent amount of them finished though.  ** the background artwork used for each character's page is not my own, credit goes to https://twitter.com/EvernightStudio **
